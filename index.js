It doesn't hear your calls. At discord, our bot ranked first in terms of privacy. Your information doesn't come to our servers, it is only on your logged-in device/devices. Everything is end-to-end encrypted and there is no way we know which data is coming from which server. During these online times, privacy is a rare thing. So we here want your data to only be yours and shared only if you want to. This is our privacy. We designed our bot based on privacy. It is hard but it matters.")
